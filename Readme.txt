Repository for Econ 202A. The slides are a bit confusing, so I have started writing them up in Latex. Feel free to add comments / suggestions.

TODO:
* Finish writing up slides in Latex
* Figure out professor's notation and fix his mistakes
* add clarifications / notes to make lecture slides easier to understand (Note: custom command will be written for this)
* Style / Visualization Prettyification
